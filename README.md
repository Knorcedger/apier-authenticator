# apier-authenticator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Knorcedger/apier-authenticator.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Knorcedger/apier-authenticator)

### Part of the [apier](https://github.com/Knorcedger/apier) framework

Checks if the user making a request is authenticated.  
It takes the token, found in req.requestData.token (placed there by [apier-dataParser](https://github.com/Knorcedger/apier-dataparser))  
checks if that token corresponds to a valid session and loads the user
that logged in and was assigned that token.

It is mainly used by [apier-permissioner](https://github.com/Knorcedger/apier-permissioner)
